A Simple yet an interesting Game of guessing a number until it gets matched to the number picked by the computer randomly


""" 
We are going to write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it
1) if the players guess is higher than the actual number the program displays lower number please
2) similarly if the guess is too low it will display higher number please
3) And if userguess is equal to the random number taken by the computer , it will display you guessed it right
